      <h1>Unity - Official Tutorials</h1>
      <p><small>Or go <a href="../">back to home</a></small></p>

      <p>I recommend you do some of <a target="_blank" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials">Unity's official tutorials</a>.</p>

      <p>If you find the videos too fast to keep up (or too slow and boring), you can change the video speed by clicking on the cog icon in the lower right hand corner of the video player.</p>

      <p>Here are some extra notes about some of the tutorials. All times given are in hours and minutes, so 1:15 means 1 hour, 15 minutes. I hope this helps you decide which tutorials to spend your time on.</p>

      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial">Roll-a-ball tutorial</a> (1:15)</h3>
      <p>Short and simple. Everyone should do this.</p>

      <p>Highlights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moving the camera</li>
        <li>Displaying score on the screen</li>
        <li>Make something happen when the player touches an object</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial">Space Shooter tutorial</a> (5:06)</h3>
      <p>Split into 3 hours of basics, then 2 hours of extension work (which I recommend doing). There's also 1:36 on making a mobile (touch screen) version which I didn't watch and didn't count in the total time.</p>

      <p><b>Warning:</b> the video was made using an older version of Unity. Messages will pop up telling you when you have to do something different to how it is shown. If you are still confused, click on the 'YouTube' link in the lower right corner of the video to go to YouTube, and look through the comments to see if someone has helpful advice.</p>

      <p>Highlights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>better lighting</li>
        <li>shooting \ making shots appear</li>
        <li>using a game controller to make waves of enemies appear</li>
        <li>using arrays to easily have variations of enemies (or anything)</li>
        <li>explosion effects</li>
        <li>playing sounds</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/survival-shooter-tutorial">Survival Shooter tutorial</a> (3:55)</h3>
      <p>(Only 3:35 if you leave out the final 20 minutes that are about special audio features.)</p>

      <p><b>Warning:</b> the video was made using an older version of Unity. The download includes a document listing some of the changes you will have to make, so glance through that before you start. If you still get stuck, click on the 'YouTube' link in the lower right corner of the video to go to YouTube, and look through the comments to see if someone has helpful advice.</p>

      <p>I encountered a bug with the damage puff emitter. If you shot an enemy, waited, then shot again, the damage effect didn't appear the second time or ever again. https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-system-plays-only-once?page=2#comments - see JEFEQUESO's solution.</p>


      <p>Highlights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using a game controller to create waves of enemies (again)</li>
        <li>displaying score (again)</li>

        <li>Enemy movement AI with the navmesh</li>
        <li>Animating characters with mechanim and triggers</li>
        <li>Make a healthbar (using a UI slider, sneaky)</li>
        <li>Make the screen flash when you are hurt</li>
        <li>Shooting (raycasts), impact effects</li>
        <li>Control what a shot hits and what it passes through. Layer masks and LayerMask.GetMask("mask name")</li>
        <li>Health and damage, enemies bite when close to the player</li>
        <li>Animated UI (making text change size, fade in and out, etc, using mechanim)</li>
        <li>UI elements are drawn in layers in the order they appear in the heirachy view</li>
        <li>Fade the camera to black (or any color) using a full-screen UI image - part 10</li>
        <li>You can animate anything using mechanim! positions, shapes, sizes, colors!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Small but interesting tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SetActive is for a whole object, enabled is for one component. - part 7</li>
        <li>Apply changes to a prefab (button at top of inspector)</li>
        <li>Give a gameobject a custom icon (top left in the Inspector)</li>
        <li>You can edit a script by clicking on its name in the 'script' field in inspector.</li>
        <li>You can comment with /* */ as well as //</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/tanks-tutorial">Tanks tutorial</a> (3:55)</h3>

      <h4>tanks phase 1</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>use simple colliders on everything, not mesh colliders</li>
        <li>dust trails: a particle emitter can emit particles over distance</li>
        <li>(set simulation space to world and emission on distance)</li>
        <li>Game Objects have void OnEnable() as well as Awake() and Start(). OnEnable happens every time it's enabled, great for resetting.</li>
        <li>On a rigidbody, kinematic means 'forces do not affect it'</li>
        <li>autocomplete is helpful</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>tanks phase 2</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Rotations and moving things</li>
        <li>Finding errors, especially unassigned reference errors</li>
        <li>changing audio pitch to avoid phasing, audio changing with speed</li>
        <li>using prefabs, updating, seeing what has changed from the prefab</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>tanks phase 3 - camera</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>camera rig to help position the camera</li>
        <li>orthographic cameras, how they work in detail</li>
        <li>Vector3.SmoothDamp</li>
        <li>Move camera to show everyone in a group of objects!!</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>tanks phase 4</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>putting UI in the game world instead of screen (a few settings to change)</li>
        <li>(make a canvas a child object of a game object to make it move around with it)</li>
        <li>Make a circular\radial health bar</li>
        <li>Performance tip: Reuse a particle effect instead of creating a new one each time</li>
        <li>(handy tip: hold alt and expand something in the Heirachy to expand the whole tree)</li>
        <li>(handy tip: hold shift and select multiple things in the heirachy. You can edit multiple objects at once)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>tanks phase 5 - Shell Creation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>(handy tip: You can call destroy with a delay, for example "destroy this shell in 5 seconds")</li>
        <li>Deal damage and apply movement force in an explosion area using OverlapSphere</li>
        <li>.... i haven't done the rest of this tutorial yet...</li>
      </ul>
