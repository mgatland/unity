      <h1>Making games with Unity</h1>
      <p>Matthew Gatland – AUT – Digital Design Studio II</p>

<!--
Things to do:

Teach students how to ask for help - they need to share their project with me, explain how, in detail, with Google Drive (online, not the app)

- more activities \ worksheet-style

- I should probably make my lecture slides in unity!

The NPC-Chat tutorial needs a polish and more step-by-step screenshots
It exists in both slide version and webpage version. Maybe get rid of the slides.

Tutorials to find or create (in priority order):
- Raycast with layers to exclude certain things
- expand NPC-chat tutorial to have proper dialogue boxes
  - people want dialogue options
- loading a new level
- health, damage, healthbars
- maybe do a locked door \ unlock with item\lever
- Animate a 3d model with mechanim (this is in Survival Shooter)
- use Navmesh to make simple seeking enemies (this is in Survival Shooter)
- Use a Game Controller to spawn enemies or something?
- Particle effects? Shooting?

Add some more game-mechanicy Game of the Week games, maybe Superhot, Tunic.
I'd like an Increpare game too (Subway Adventure, Slave of God, Activate the 3 Artefacts and Leave)

      <h2>Tutorials</h2>

      <p>I've listed the time in hours and minutes next to each activity. For example, (1:12) means 1 hour and 12 minutes.</p>

      <p>Unity is always changing so some tutorials are out of date. If you find a problem, watch out for annotations in the video, and read the YouTube comments for advice.</p>

      <h3>General tutorials</h3>

      <h3>Specific topics</h3>

      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_690402409&feature=iv&src_vid=ITFEpm15bRM&v=9hPYXi5aXzw">Creating a Main Menu</a> by Michael Marsh (0:09).</p>

      <h3>Even more</h3>

      <p>The official tutorials are good, but long. I have written up some notes on <a href="official-tutorials/">what each tutorial covers</a> so you can decide if you want to spend time on them.</p>

      <h2>Starting your project</h2>

      <p>After you do two or three of the official Unity tutorials, you will be ready to start your own project. You should know enough Unity terms to be able to know what you don't know, and research it online.</p>
