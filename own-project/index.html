      <h1>Working on your own Unity project</h1>
      <p><small>Or go <a href="../">back to home</a></small></p>

      <h2>Finding out how to do stuff</h2>

      <p>There are lots of online discussions, and great documentation, so searching online is the best way to find answers. You can explore the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html">Unity Manual</a> for general Unity info, and the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/index.html" target="_blank">Unity Scripting API</a> for information on scripting (writing code).</p>

      <p>If you are searching online using a search engine like google, put 'Unity' or 'Unity3D' in your query. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=unity3d+look+at+another+gameobject&oq=unity3d+look+at+another+gameobject&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65j69i60l3j0.3671j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">"Unity3d look at another gameobject."</a></p>

      <h2>Collaboration tools</h2>

      <p>(to do later: compare Perforce, Git, and Unity Collaborate)</p>

      <h3>BitBucket and SourceTree</h3>

      <p>I don't recommend it right now</p>

      <h3>Unity Collaborate</h3>

      <p>Unity Collaborate is a tool designed to help teams work together on a Unity project. It is free for team of up to 4 people with projects of up to 1 GB (which is quite small.)</p>

      <p>Unfortunately Unity Collaborate is not working properly at AUT. You can still use it, but you need to close and reopen Unity every time you want to see the current collab state (every time you download a teammate's changes or publish your own changes. This can be annoying.</p>

      <p>If you want to try using Unity Collaborate anyway, click through to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityCollaborate.html">official Unity Collaborate documentation</a> to learn how to use it.</p>

      <h3>Other collaboration ideas</h3>

      <p>If you do not to use Unity Collaborate, you need to think about how you will get everyone's work together into the same project. Some tips:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Make it easy for any team member to add their work to the project. For example, put the project in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> folder that everyone can edit. Dropbox automatically copies changed files to everyone's computer.</li>
        <li>If you use Dropbox, you must avoid having two people working on the project at the same time.</li>
        <li>Make regular backups!</li>
      </ul>
